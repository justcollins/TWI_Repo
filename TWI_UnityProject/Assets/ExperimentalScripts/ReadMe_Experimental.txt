This folder is for all experimental scripts done by programmers that have been apart
of the Project Planning Phase.

The scripts in this folder are potentially full of errors, which may cause the project to not 
compile later on. Due to this, this folder might be removed at a later date, or put into a .zip
file so that all of the content is still with us, but just not accessible to the compiler.

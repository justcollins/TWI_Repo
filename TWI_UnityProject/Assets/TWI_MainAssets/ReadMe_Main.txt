This is the Main folder where all Assets(Scripts/Models/etc) will be stored in for all things made after 12/19/15.
Everything made before 12/19/15 is to be considered experimental and is located in the ExperimentalScripts folder.

Inside of this folder, are personal work folders for every member of the team, along with folders containing prefabs, materials, and models for what the team might need
for testing.

Please make your own folder with the naming convention: TWI_PRO_(your initials here)
Example: TWI_PRO_JC

All of the work you do will be within that folder. Please name everything appropriately. Everything should be named, so that someone else can come in and use your work
easily without having to go and ask you where to find it. So please, folder organization and naming conventions should be well done.
For a good example of this, please go see TWI_PRO_JP, or TWI_PRO_AR for their folder organization and naming conventions of scripts.

When writing your scripts, please make sure to give all variables and functions access modifiers. Access modifiers 
that are used are: Private, Public, Protected, Internal or Protected Internal.
It is good practice to assign them to your variables yourself and makes code more readable and easier to understand. This does not apply to variables that are created within
functions.

If you are doing integration with someone elses code, and they do not have a function written or there is a variable that you need to access but cannot due to its accessibility
, do not go into their code and fix it yourself. Please contact them via facebook/email/text and say that what you need them to do in their scripts, so that they can quickly
get that written for you so you can continue to work on your scripts. This is to avoid possible conflicts with GitHub when pushing new versions to the master branch.
